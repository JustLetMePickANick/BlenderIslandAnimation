BlenderIslandAnimation
======================

The FinalIslandScene directory contains everything needed to recreate the animation
in FinalIslandScene/SceneComposition/FinalScene.avi

There are a number of problems with this animation that could be worked on.

1. Trees flicker during animation. Apparently this is connected the the "Blender Internal"
   render engine, and is called z-fighting. Blender cycles should not have this problem, so
   it would be interesting to redo this in render cycles.
2. The horizon is too curved. 
3. The sea animation is not so smooth. Watch the waves on the island beach. This could be better.
